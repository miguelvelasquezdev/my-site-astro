    <p>
        Hey! My name is Miguel Velásquez, and I am Software Developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am into the latest technologies and the OSS world. I am curious about <code class={codeStyle}>SSR</code>, <code class={codeStyle}>Edge Runtime ⚡️</code>, <code class={codeStyle}>Devops Workflows</code>, <code class={codeStyle}>How to reduce costs when the project scales 📈</code> and <code class={codeStyle}>Distributed Systems vs Monoliths 🥊</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I like to go to natural spaces 🍂🌞, do exercise, and enjoy the now.<br /> Also, I like to meet foreign people, btw I speak 3 idioms (Spanish, Portuguese, and English) and learning German. I like to know new cultures and be aware of social problems around the world.
    </p>

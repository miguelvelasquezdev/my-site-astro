                <p>I am happy to have worked at <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://rappi.com">Rappi</a>, because is a <code class={codeStyle}>Colombian Unicorn Startup ðŸ¦„ Series B backed by YC</code>. Rappi solves the food delivery demand in LatAm and improves Colombia's economy.</p>
                <p>At Rappi, I was Frontend Developer, working with MicroFrontends due to the Software Engineers' quantity and high requests demand for the app.</p>
                <p>I worked in the CX area, called <code class={codeStyle}>Lupe</code>, the platform where agents solve tons of client complaints.</p>
                <p>There, I analyzed and discussed with my âœ¨multicultural teamâœ¨ the creation of features that require <code class={codeStyle}>scalability resilience</code>. I monitored a large microservices structure, created alarms for possible frauds, did code reviewing, and always was curious about the Rappi business logic.</p>

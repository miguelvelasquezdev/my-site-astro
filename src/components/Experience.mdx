<JobTitle />

I am happy to have worked at Rappi, cause is a `Colombian Unicorn Startup ðŸ¦„ backed by YC`. Rappi solves the food delivery demand in LatAm and improves the Colombia's economy.

At Rappi, I was Frontend Developer, working with MicroFronteds due to the Software Engineers quantity and high requests demand on the app.

I worked in the CX area, called `Lupe`, the platform where agents solve tons of client complaints.

There, I analized and discussed with my âœ¨multicultural teamâœ¨ about the creation of features that require `scalability resilience`, monitored a large microservices structure, created alarms for possible frauds, did code reviewing, and always was curious about the Rappi business logic.

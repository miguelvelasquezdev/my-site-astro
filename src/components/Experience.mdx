## Rappi

I am happy to have worked at [**Rappi**]('https://rappi.com'), cause is a `Colombian Unicorn Startup ðŸ¦„ backed by YC`. Rappi solves the food delivery demand in LatAm and improves Colombia's economy.

At Rappi, I was Frontend Developer, working with MicroFrontends due to the Software Engineers' quantity and high requests demand for the app.

I worked in the CX area, called `Lupe`, the platform where agents solve tons of client complaints.

There, I analyzed and discussed with my âœ¨multicultural teamâœ¨ the creation of features that require `scalability resilience`. I monitored a large microservices structure, created alarms for possible frauds, did code reviewing, and always was curious about the Rappi business logic.

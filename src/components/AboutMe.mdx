# About Me

Hey! My name is Miguel Velásquez, and I am Software Developer.

I am into the latest technologies and OSS world. I am curious about `Server Components`, `Edge Runtime ⚡️`, `Static Outputs`, `Devops Workflows`, `How to reduce costs when the project scales 📈` and `Microservices vs Monoliths 🥊 `.

In my free time, I like to go to natural spaces 🍂🍃🌞, do exercise, and enjoy the now.<br /> Also, I like to meet foreign people, btw I speak 3 idioms (spanish, portuguese and english) and learning German 🤓. I like to know new cultures and be aware about the social problematics.

## Why Astro?

I decided to do my personal site with Astro over other UI Frameworks because it lets me integrate different UI Frameworks (React, SolidJS, Svelte, etc...). I can use Server Components, Signals, SSR, or just with the power of Astro that is the âœ¨dehydrationâœ¨.

## How is your site built?

My site has React and MDX integrated. Almost 90% of my site is made on MDX (JSX in Markdown).

## What about styles?

Tailwind.
